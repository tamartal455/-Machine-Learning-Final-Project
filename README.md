# Machine Learning Final Project
**By: Matan Gazit and Tamar Tal**

Done as the final project for an Intro to Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.

We were given a real data - set containing 22 features about users of an online shopping site (E-Commerce), some known and some anonymous, and were tasked with building a classifier to classify whether a particular user, would purchase while browsing the site or not. The project contains exploratory data analysis, visualization, feature selection and engineering, modeling and validation.

The project is in Jupyter Notebook in Python and Markdown.
